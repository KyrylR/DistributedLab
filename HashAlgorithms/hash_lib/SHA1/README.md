# Theory
In fact, a feature of SHA-1 is the cyclic mixing and use of basic bitwise operations on the input data. 
Scheme of execution of one cycle of SHA-1 algorithm is as follows:

Where Kt are constants;
* Ft - variable function (changes every 20 cycles);
* Wi - modified element of incoming message (4 bytes);
* << x - cyclic shift to the left.

## Pseudo-code:
``` 
Note 1: All variables are unsigned 32-bit quantities and wrap modulo 232 when calculating, except for
        ml, the message length, which is a 64-bit quantity, and
        hh, the message digest, which is a 160-bit quantity.
Note 2: All constants in this pseudo code are in big endian.
        Within each word, the most significant byte is stored in the leftmost byte position

Initialize variables:

h0 = 0x67452301
h1 = 0xEFCDAB89
h2 = 0x98BADCFE
h3 = 0x10325476
h4 = 0xC3D2E1F0

ml = message length in bits (always a multiple of the number of bits in a character).

Pre-processing:
append the bit '1' to the message e.g. by adding 0x80 if message length is a multiple of 8 bits.
append 0 ≤ k < 512 bits '0', such that the resulting message length in bits
   is congruent to −64 ≡ 448 (mod 512)
append ml, the original message length in bits, as a 64-bit big-endian integer. 
   Thus, the total length is a multiple of 512 bits.

Process the message in successive 512-bit chunks:
break message into 512-bit chunks
for each chunk
    break chunk into sixteen 32-bit big-endian words w[i], 0 ≤ i ≤ 15

    Message schedule: extend the sixteen 32-bit words into eighty 32-bit words:
    for i from 16 to 79
        Note 3: SHA-0 differs by not having this leftrotate.
        w[i] = (w[i-3] xor w[i-8] xor w[i-14] xor w[i-16]) leftrotate 1

    Initialize hash value for this chunk:
    a = h0
    b = h1
    c = h2
    d = h3
    e = h4

    Main loop:[10][56]
    for i from 0 to 79
        if 0 ≤ i ≤ 19 then
            f = (b and c) or ((not b) and d)
            k = 0x5A827999
        else if 20 ≤ i ≤ 39
            f = b xor c xor d
            k = 0x6ED9EBA1
        else if 40 ≤ i ≤ 59
            f = (b and c) or (b and d) or (c and d) 
            k = 0x8F1BBCDC
        else if 60 ≤ i ≤ 79
            f = b xor c xor d
            k = 0xCA62C1D6

        temp = (a leftrotate 5) + f + e + k + w[i]
        e = d
        d = c
        c = b leftrotate 30
        b = a
        a = temp

    Add this chunk's hash to result so far:
    h0 = h0 + a
    h1 = h1 + b 
    h2 = h2 + c
    h3 = h3 + d
    h4 = h4 + e

Produce the final hash value (big-endian) as a 160-bit number:
hh = (h0 leftshift 128) or (h1 leftshift 96) or (h2 leftshift 64) or (h3 leftshift 32) or h4
```
